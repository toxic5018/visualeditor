# VisualEditor - Web-based Visual Programming Interface

VisualEditor is an interactive web-based editor designed to help users create, visualize, and interact with programs in a simple, intuitive interface. It aims to provide a graphical environment where users can drag and drop various elements to design their code flow. VisualEditor is ideal for both beginners and experienced developers who want to prototype or build programs without diving deep into syntax-heavy coding.

## How to Use VisualEditor

1. **Create a New Project**  
   Start by clicking on the "New Project" button to initialize a new editor instance.

2. **Add Elements to the Canvas**  
   From the left sidebar, drag and drop different components (like loops, variables, functions, etc.) onto the main canvas area.

3. **Link Elements**  
   Connect the components by drawing lines between them to define the flow of your program.

4. **Edit Properties**  
   Click on any element to edit its properties or customize its behavior. This might include changing the name, setting conditions, or configuring other settings.

5. **Test Your Program**  
   Use the buttons in the top-right corner to run, pause, or stop your program. The editor allows you to interact with your program as it runs, making it easy to test and debug.

6. **Save Your Work**  
   Once you've completed your work, you can save it locally or upload it to the cloud for future access.
